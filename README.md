#BOSCall - Fire Alarms token to a digital level
The app's main purpose is to put analogue alarms of volunteer fire departments to a digital level. There are indeed options on the market but all of them share the same problem: Money! The additional alarm option is in most cases paid by public charity. A few euros are often already too much.

This app offers a open-source solution to these units. The only things they need:
* A computer to register alarms and compute alarm messages for the digital alarm on the app
* A server (or computer with public IP) to...
    * Receive alarms from the computer that registers analogue alarms
    * Distribute alarms to the devices
    * Manage registrations of alarm receivers
* A firebase account for distribution
